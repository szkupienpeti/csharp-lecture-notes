# C# Lecture Notes for Beginners

:page_with_curl::computer: I wrote these lecture notes in 2019 when I taught programming to secondary school students at [Szent István Gimnázium](https://szigbp.hu/) as an extracurricular activity, organized by [Bolyai János Mathematics Company](https://www.bolyai.hu/english/), sponsored by [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/).

:boy::girl: In that year, the students were 13-year-old beginners, which is mirrored by the language and professionality of the notes.

:abcd::bulb: The language of the notes is Hungarian. Originally it was written in Word but in 2022 I decided to transform it to LaTeX, based on [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/modular-forms-of-half-integral-weights-noncongruence-subgroups-metaplectic-groups/dpjpnttqtxmz).
